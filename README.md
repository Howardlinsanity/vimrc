# About this .vimrc 
This is John Brawner's .vimrc, with a few extra additions from me. 

Thank you John for providing this to me when I was a wee freshmen, it has encouraged me to use vim more often.

For those that are interested in this, this .vimrc is designed to provide numerous IDE like tools such as linting and autocompletion while also being extremely friendly towards new users.

## Installation: 
1. Make sure you have python 3 loaded into vim - if you don't, many plugins will complain when you start vim and will not work.
2. Download/clone this .vimrc, place it in your root folder, and then restart your terminal.

### Note: 
This .vimrc will also work in neovim, as most of the plugins still work.

Hope this .vimrc will encourage you to use vim!

Thank you for reading this.
